Data Pipeline Project â€“ Orders Processing

 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a data pipeline that ingests, validates, and processes order data from multiple sources using Azure Data Lake (ADLS Gen2), Azure Data Factory (ADF), Databricks, Azure SQL Database, and Amazon S3.
The pipeline ensures:
1.	Incoming files (orders.csv) are validated.
o	No duplicate order_id.
o	Valid order_status based on a reference table.
2.	Valid files are moved to the staging folder, and invalid ones go to the discarded folder.
3.	Additional integration with Amazon S3 for order_items and Azure SQL DB for customers.
4.	Aggregated results (orders per customer & spending) are pushed back to SQL DB for reporting.

 Architecture
Data Flow:
Third-party service â†’ ADLS Gen2 (Landing) â†’ ADF (trigger) â†’ Databricks (validation & transformation) â†’ ADLS Gen2 (Staging/Discarded) â†’ Azure SQL DB (validations, reporting)
Components Used:
â€¢	Azure Data Lake Gen2 (ADLS) â€“ Landing, Staging, Discarded folders.
â€¢	Azure Data Factory (ADF) â€“ Orchestration & Storage Event Triggers.
â€¢	Databricks â€“ Data validation, transformations, Spark jobs.
â€¢	Azure SQL Database â€“ Stores valid order_status & customer details.
â€¢	Azure Key Vault â€“ Secrets management (DB password, tokens).
â€¢	Amazon S3 â€“ Source for order_items.json.

ðŸ—‚ Resources to be Created
â€¢	Storage Account
o	Container with folders: landing, staging, discarded
â€¢	Databricks Workspace
â€¢	Data Factory
â€¢	Key Vault
â€¢	Azure SQL Database
o	Table: valid_order_status
o	Table: customers
________________________________________
Datasets
â€¢	Orders â†’ CSV dropped into ADLS landing folder.
â€¢	Order Items â†’ JSON from Amazon S3.
â€¢	Customers â†’ Published in Azure SQL Database.
________________________________________
Validations Implemented
1.	Order ID check â€“ No duplicates allowed.
2.	Order Status check â€“ Must exist in valid_order_status lookup table.
 If validations pass â†’ Move to staging.
 If validations fail â†’ Move to discarded.
________________________________________
 Security & Secrets
â€¢	All credentials (DB password, Databricks token, Storage keys) are stored in Azure Key Vault.
â€¢	Databricks accesses Key Vault using secret scopes.
________________________________________
 Future Enhancements
â€¢	Support for multiple file types dynamically (not just orders.csv).
â€¢	Automated mounting/unmounting for Databricks file system.
â€¢	Advanced transformations and reporting.
